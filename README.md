## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jacob Sides, a passionate JavaScript developer, diving deep into front-end and headless technologies, staring at interactive 3D sites in the distance. If I'm not trying out a new JS framework, you'll find me gaming, jamming to music or attempting to pick up a new skill, whether it's the Bass or ASL. 


## My Work
I've been fortunate enough to work with fantastic designers at Pyxl to build out their visions. 

[Brownlee](https://brownlee.co) - A Next.js Shopify Plus Headless Ecommerce

[Trimech](https://trimech.com) - WordPress Woocommerce site with Vue.js search and archive functionalities

[MLILY](https://mlilyusa.com) - WordPress Woocommerce site built with TailwindCSS, Twig and Vue.js archives

[Talkiatry](https://talkiatry.com) - WordPress site built with TailwindCSS, Twig and Vue.js archives

I left Pyxl to join the brilliant engineers at DRC as a Software Developer.
I worked there for 16 months, learning about industrial-grade AWS and Angular before I left to work on my own clients.

### Side Projects
All my repos here are primarily side projects that focus more concepts, teaching and tech-stacks rather than front-end development. Nonetheless, see how obsessed I am with the Spotify API.
