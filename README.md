## Hi there 👋
I'm Jacob Sides, a passionate JavaScript developer, diving deep into front-end and headless technologies, staring at interactive 3D sites in the distance. If I'm not trying out a new JS framework, you'll find me gaming, jamming to music or attempting to pick up a new skill, whether it's the Bass or German. 


## My Work
I've been fortunate enough to work with fantastic designers at Pyxl to build out their visions.

### Side Projects
All my repos here are primarily side projects that focus more concepts, teaching and tech-stacks rather than front-end development. Nonetheless, see how obsessed I am with the Spotify API.
